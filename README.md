# Enhancing Academic Engagement Using AI Technology.

AI-powered assistant to enhance students' academic experience. It securely manages access to materials like syllabi and timetables, answers academic queries via NLP, and offers cloud-based storage for anytime, anywhere access. Aimed at improving engagement and learning outcomes.

Proposed System / Innovation:

The proposed system, "Enhancing Academic Engagement Using AI Technology", aims to revolutionize the way students interact with academic institutions by developing an AI-powered chatbot that provides personalized support and guidance to students.

This innovative approach will be made possible through the strategic integration of cutting-edge AI technologies, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, to create a conversational AI model that can understand and respond to student queries in a highly personalized and context-specific way.

The ultimate goal is to revolutionize academic engagement, drive improved student outcomes, by using the power of AI to provide 24/7 support.

Features:

User Authentication: Secure access using institutional emails and roll numbers.
Document Management: Efficient retrieval of academic resources such as syllabi, timetables, and PDFs.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Conversational assistant to answer academic queries and provide information.
Cloud-Based Access: Access academic materials anytime, anywhere.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core functionality and NLP algorithms.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): To process and understand student queries.
Cloud Storage: For storing academic materials and enabling remote access.
Authentication: Secure login via institutional email and roll numbers.

Usage:

After logging in with your institutional email and roll number, you can interact with the assistant.
Ask academic questions, request course materials, or get quick access to your timetable and syllabus.
The assistant uses advanced NLP to understand your queries and provide accurate responses.

Google Vertex AI Integration

This project leverages Google Vertex AI API to provide advanced language models and machine learning capabilities for better student interactions. The API helps improve the assistant's ability to understand complex academic queries and provide more accurate, context-aware responses.

To use Google Vertex AI, you must:

Set up a Google Cloud project.
Enable Vertex AI API in your Google Cloud console.
Obtain the necessary credentials (API Key or Service Account) for authentication.
For detailed instructions on how to set up Google Vertex AI, refer to Google Cloud Vertex AI Documentation.
